# Alpaca Image Generator

My attempt at this project with the following info stated below.

## Requirements

- A website to let you customize your own alpaca profile picture (or desired image)
- Customization panel
- Randomize feature
- Download generated image feature

The following GIF shows one way to implement the UI. Feel free to interpret the requirements however you'd like!

## Suggested Implementation

- Get your image assets ready. You could use the alpaca images [we provided](https://ucarecdn.com/b2200aac-7cc6-44ff-a2cb-6fd7861d683d/alpacageneratorassets.zip) or use your own ones for your image generator.
- Prepare your preferred front end stack. We recommend using tools like [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) if you want to have a quick setup.
- Create an alpaca (image) preview UI
- Add list of buttons for customizing your alpaca (image)
- Add randomized alpaca feature

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
